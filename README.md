MazeOverkill
============

What this is? Nothing too fancy...
Just a totally overkill implementation of some IT-class homework.
The homework was to develop an algorithm to solve a maze... one **paper!!** how old-school

So, why not implement a simulator for mazes and let others have the ability to implement algorithms?

Much cooler, right?
